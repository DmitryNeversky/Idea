# Idea Platform

Individual project which was used as Pet-project. It hasn't found an appointment, so It's decided to open that for a public. I found it useful for processing requests from employee inside a company. Wich request has status(accepted, looking, declined). Before using the system each user must be registered. Btw, there is a cool interface :D I spent on it much time and there is adaptation existing for every device as well.
